# Tic-Tac-Toe
One of the most popular and enduring games of all time is Tic-Tac-Toe. Because of its familiarity, this game is often used as a starting example to mathematically analyze a decision-making process. Its brevity makes it a perfect game to illustrate the rewards of thinking ahead and learning the consequence of each decision.
In this assignment, you need to build an RL agent that learns to play Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe with odd numbers (the agent will always make the first move). You need to train your agent using Q-Learning.
